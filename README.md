# Building-an-AI-Classifier-Identifying-Cats-Dogs-Pandas-with-PyTorch

## Procedure:

## Step 1: Dataset Collection and Organization

* The quality and diversity of your dataset strongly influence model accuracy. Collect a large number of images for cats, dogs, and pandas from public datasets (e.g., Kaggle, ImageNet) or personal sources.

* Organize the dataset into train, validation, and test sets. This ensures proper model evaluation and prevents overfitting:

  * Training set: Used to train the model; should contain the majority of images (e.g., 70%).

  * Validation set: Used to tune hyperparameters and check model generalization (e.g., 15%).

  * Test set: Used for final evaluation of the model on unseen images (e.g., 15%).

* Each set should have subfolders for each class: cats/, dogs/, pandas/.

* Ensure class balance to prevent the model from being biased toward the more frequent class.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

* Images vary in size, color, and lighting conditions. Preprocessing ensures consistency:

  * Resize images to a standard size (e.g., 224×224 pixels) to match CNN input requirements.

   * Normalize pixel values to a standard range (0–1) or use mean and standard deviation normalization, which helps pretrained models converge faster.

* Data augmentation artificially expands the training dataset and reduces overfitting:

   * Flips (horizontal, vertical) to simulate different perspectives.

   * Rotations to make the model invariant to orientation.

   * Zoom and crop to focus on parts of the object.

   * Brightness, contrast, or color jittering to handle varying lighting conditions.

* Augmentation is applied only to the training set, not validation or test sets.

## Step 3: Loading the Dataset in PyTorch

* PyTorch provides tools to simplify dataset handling:

  * Use torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder to automatically map image folders to labels.

  * Use DataLoader to feed batches of images into the model efficiently, which is essential for GPU training.

* Batch size: Determines how many images are processed at once; a typical choice is 16–64, depending on GPU memory.

* Shuffling the training data ensures the model does not learn patterns based on the order of images.

## Step 4: Selecting and Defining the Model

* For image classification, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are highly effective. Using transfer learning is recommended:

   * Pretrained models already know how to extract features like edges, textures, and shapes.

* Suitable models for this task:

    1. ResNet18 – Efficient, accurate, and small; ideal for medium datasets and fast training.

    2. VGG16 – Deep network capturing detailed features; more  computationally intensive.

    3. MobileNetV2 – Lightweight and optimized for mobile/low-resource deployment.

* Replace the final classification layer to output 3 neurons (one for each class).

## Step 5: Defining Loss Function and Optimizer

* Loss function measures the error between predicted and true labels. For multi-class classification, CrossEntropyLoss is standard.

* Optimizer updates the model’s weights to minimize loss:

   * Adam: Adaptive learning rate, fast convergence.

  * SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent): More stable but may require tuning of learning rate and momentum.

* Learning rate is crucial; too high → model may diverge, too low → training will be slow.

## Step 6: Training the Model

* Training involves multiple epochs, where the model sees the entire training dataset multiple times.

* Steps in each epoch:

1. Forward pass: Input images pass through the CNN to produce predictions.

2. Loss computation: Compare predictions to true labels using the loss function.

3. Backward pass: Calculate gradients using backpropagation.

4. Weight update: Optimizer adjusts the weights to reduce loss.

* Use validation set evaluation after each epoch to monitor:

  * Accuracy

  * Loss trends

  * Overfitting signs (e.g., training accuracy high but validation accuracy low)

## Step 7: Model Evaluation

* After training, evaluate the model using the test set, which contains images unseen by the model.

* Key metrics:

   * Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.

   * Precision: Correct positive predictions per class.

  * Recall: How well the model detects each class.

  * F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

* Optionally, create a confusion matrix to visualize which classes are confused by the model.

## Step 8: Model Saving and Loading

* Save the trained model using PyTorch’s state_dict, allowing you to reload it later without retraining:
```

 torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
```

Load the model for future use:

 * Initialize the model architecture and call 
```
 model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth')).
```

* This enables predictions on new data anytime.

## Step 9: Prediction on New Images

* Preprocess new images the same way as training images (resize, normalize).

* Pass images through the trained model to obtain predicted probabilities for each class.

* Select the class with the highest probability as the predicted label.

* This step allows practical use, such as classifying images from a camera or uploaded files.

## Step 10: Deployment (Optional)

* For real-world usage, convert the trained model to formats suitable for deployment:

  * TorchScript: For deployment in Python apps or C++ programs.

  * ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange): For interoperability with other frameworks or mobile apps.

* Integrate the model with a web interface, mobile app, or cloud service for real-time predictions.

* Monitor model performance continuously and update with new data if necessary.

## Models Used:

1. ResNet18 – Efficient, accurate, good for medium-sized datasets, fast training.

2. VGG16 – Deep, detailed feature extraction, suitable for large datasets.

3. MobileNetV2 – Lightweight, efficient, suitable for low-resource environments or mobile deployment.

## Key Considerations:

* Transfer learning is preferred over training from scratch.

* Model selection depends on dataset size, computational resources, and deployment scenario.

* Data augmentation and preprocessing are critical for model generalization.
